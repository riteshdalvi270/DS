Given a list of millions of documents, how would you find all the documents that contain a list of words? The words can appear in any order, bu they must be
complete words. eg book is not equal to book keeper.

Approach 1

Step1: Scope your system
a. Will the user provide me with the list of words? will this be auto generated? The point is how will be my system heavily used?

Assume user provides the list of words and the documents are sorted with words (terrible process-this needs rework).

Step2:
System:
 -> Application layer : User
 -> Server : (partitioned) containing millions of documents.
        -> partitioned using : dictionary based partitioning

If its heavy read, do we need cache?

Step 3:
 examples: {book, bike} -> Dictionary based solution -> point to server1 (node 1) -> contains documents from 1 to 1000

           {dance, duke} -> Dictionary based solution ->point to server1 (node 1)

           {zap, zip} ->  Dictionary based solution -> point to server5 (node 6).

 This system wont scale well, because it assumes the documents to be sorted with words.


Approach 2:
document A contains words bike, dance, zap.

document B contains words apple, banana, grapes.


how will you efficiently retrieve the document?
