Design a system for social network and algorithm for shortest path.

eg Susan -> Lina -> Sabrina

1. There are millions of users, our system should be smart enough to reduce the communication (we should smartly divide the nodes having users, but how?)
 -> The users tend to communicate with people in their demographics mostly.
 -> divide the users depending on the demographics. (tend to have less coostly processing).

2. Have recent communication for the user (store it in a cache?, LRU cache?)
 -> Users tend to chat with same people most of the times

3.  Build a system based on vertical partitioning (the recent profiles or recent contacts together).

4.
